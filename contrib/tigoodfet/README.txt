Howdy y'all,

At some point, I'd like to have a hand-held GoodFET terminal based
upon a TI graphing calculator.  It's staying in contrib because the
first few revisions will be half-assed hacks.

The client should be written in C, generic enough to also target the
GirlTech IM ME and similar devices.  There is quite a bit of
difficulty in maintaining a changing protocol in both directions, so
perhaps an RPC method of some sort will come about.  Clients for the
calculator will focus on radio clients and other things which demand
portability.

Feel free to beat me to the punch on this one.  I want the code to
exist more than I want to be the one to have written it.
