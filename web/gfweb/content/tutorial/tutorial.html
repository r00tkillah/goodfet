<!--huseby: 1. Here's how to build it: (solder this here, solder that
here...here's how to tell which way the LED's should go)-->
<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>Construct your GoodFET as described in its Hardware page.  As of
March 2010, you probably want a GoodFET3x for embedded systems
development or a GoodFET2x for voltage glitching security research.
All previous models are still supported by the programming
software.</p>

<p><i>(A full construction article is in the works.)</i></p>

<!--huseby: 2. Now that it's built, here's how to verify it is built correctly-->
<h3>Verification</h3>

<p>If your GoodFET is properly assembled, you should see a notice in
dmesg that an FTDI USB/Serial adapter has been added on insertion of
the device.  The device name varies with operating system, but it's probably
one of /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyU0, or /dev/tty/cu.usbserial-*.</p>

<p>You should also see the RX/TX LEDs blink briefly when inserting the
device.  If they do not, their polarity is likely wrong and you will
need to desolder and rotate them.  For those without an SMD rework
station, it might be easier to burn the LEDs off and apply fresh
ones.</p>

<!--huseby: 3. Now that you know it is built correctly, here's how to
grab the software and firmware -->
<h3>Software</h3>

<p>Until a first version of the GoodFET software is released, you will
need to track the project by svn.  This makes upgrading a breeze, but
you will not be able to install the software by your favorite Linux
distribution's package manager.</p>

<p>Running the following commands will download the latest version
of the project to ~/svn/goodfet and link the client scripts into
/usr/local/bin/.  Optionally, you may add the client directory to
your $PATH if you do not have sudo privileges.</p>

<p><pre>mkdir ~/svn
cd ~/svn
svn co https://goodfet.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/goodfet
cd goodfet/trunk/client
sudo make link
</pre><br/></p>

<p><i>(TODO: Describe the installation of prerequisite packages
such as Gnuplot-py, py-sqlite3, py-serial, etc here.)</i></p>

<p>Now that the software is installed, dump the info flash of your
GoodFET to a text file for safekeeping.  This information is destroyed
when flashing the device, and in the rare even that it is needed, it
is very handy to have.  If you have the time, it would be nice to
email a copy of this file to Travis Goodspeed &lt;travis at
radiantmachines.com&gt;.</p>

<p><pre>goodfet.bsl --dumpinfo &gt;infoflash.txt
</pre><br/></p>

<p>Once this backup has been made, you can use goodfet.bsl to install
a recent version of the firmware from the Internet.  This is faster
than building the firmware from scratch, which is described in the
next session.</p>

<p><pre>goodfet.bsl --fromweb
goodfet.monitor test
</pre><br/></p>

<!--huseby: 4. here's now to load the firmware you want-->
<h3>Firmware</h3>

<p>There are two ways to get the firmware.  By far the fastest is to
use the web version by 'goodfet.bsl --fromweb', but participation in
development of the project will require you to build it from
scratch.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://mspgcc.sourceforge.net/">mspgcc</a> compiler is
preferred for the project.  You will need a recent build from CVS in
order to build the project, and most prebuilt versions floating around
the Internet are too old to be of use.  Grab the version from
<a href="http://goodserv.cis.upenn.edu/mspgcc/">http://goodserv.cis.upenn.edu/mspgcc/</a>
that matches your operating system, then extract it in /opt/ and add
/opt/mspgcc/bin to your $PATH.</p>
