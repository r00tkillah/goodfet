<h1>Development Manual</h1>

<h2>Programming</h2>

<p>The GoodFET is programmed by the MSP430's BootStrap Loader (BSL)
which is adequately documented elsewhere.  Using the tos-bsl client
from <a href="http://tinyos.net/">TinyOS</a>, an image may be programmed
by</p>
<pre>tos-bsl --invert-reset --invert-test -c -e -p foo.hex</pre>

<h2>Serial Port</h2>

<p>To minimize parts count, the DTR line, which is connected to
the !RST pin of the MSP430, is not inverted by hardware.  The
DTR line--Data Terminal Ready--is usually high when a terminal
application is connected, low when one is not.  Unless this behavior
is overridden, the GoodFET will run until a client connects, then
idle in a reset until the client disconnects.</p>

<h2>Standard Protocol</h2>

<p>Most of the GoodFET applications will use this standard protocol,
which has been composed so as to allow multiple applications to be
compiled together.</p>

<p>The baud rate is 9600 8/N/1 by default, but this may be made faster
by sending the appropriate command.</p>

<h3>Transactions</h3>

<p>The workstation may send {u8 <i>app</i>, u8 <i>verb</i>,
u8 <i>count</i>}. If <i>count</i> is non-zero, then <i>count</i> bytes of data
follow.  The target will reply with {u8 <i>app</i>, u8 <i>verb</i>,
u8 <i>count</i>} and data.</p>

<p>The GoodFET will announce that it is ready for a command by transmitting
{0x00, 0x7F, 0x00}, which is the "OK" message from the Monitor application.</p>

<h3>Apps</h3>

<p>The following table lists many application reservation codes.</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Hex</th><th>#define</th><th>Description</th><th>Status</th></tr>
<tr><td>0x00</td><td><a href="/apps/monitor/">MONITOR</a></td><td>Local Memory Monitor</td><td>Beta</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x01</td><td><a href="/apps/spi/">SPI</a></td><td>SPI Adapter</td><td>Beta</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x02</td><td><a href="/apps/i2c/">I2C</a></td><td>I<sup>2</sup>C Adapter</td><td>Pre-Alpha</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x10</td><td><a href="/apps/jtag/">JTAG</a></td><td>Standard JTAG</td><td>Beta</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x11</td><td><a href="/apps/jtag430/">JTAG430</a></td><td>MSP430 JTAG</td><td>Alpha</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x30</td><td><a href="/apps/chipcon/">Chipcon</td><td>Chipcon 8051 Debugging</td><td>Pre-Alpha</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x31</td><td>SIF</td><td>Cambridge SIF (EM2xx) Debugging</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Standard Verbs</h3>

<p>The following verbs are standardized across all applications.
An application need not support
all (or any) of them, but it must not use these codes for anything else.
All application-specific commands ought to have the most significant bit
set; that is, they must be >=0x80.</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Hex</th><th>#define</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>0x00</td><td>READ</td><td>Read data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x01</td><td>WRITE</td><td>Write data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x02</td><td>PEEK</td><td>Read from address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x03</td><td>POKE</td><td>Write to address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x10</td><td>SETUP</td><td>Configure I/O pins.</td></tr>

<tr><td>0x20</td><td>START</td><td>Start a transaction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x21</td><td>STOP</td><td>Stop a transaction.</td></tr>

<tr><td>0x7E</td><td>NOK</td><td>No Operation</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x7F</td><td>OK</td><td>No Operation</td></tr>
</table>
