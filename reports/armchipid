# ARM Chip ID Database
# 
# ARM uses various 16-byte memory addresses
# to store chip identification information.
# Due to this our goodfet.arm client could
# only correctly identify the Chip ID info
# if the memory address of the family is
# within this database. We will improve
# the method through time, but for right
# now we need to document as many mem
# addresses as possible for the ARM
# series. If you know where your ARM
# chips ID register address is please
# add it to this file. 
# 
# Example:
#	<family,chip,memory_address>
#
# 	7TDMI,SAM7S256,FFF00000
#
# Any questions: <q@theqlabs.com>

7TDMI,SAM7S256,FFF00000
