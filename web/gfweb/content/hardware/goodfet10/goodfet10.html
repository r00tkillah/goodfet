<h1>GoodFET10</h1>

<p>The GoodFET10 is the first hardware revision of the GoodFET.
Like all first-run boards, it has a few errata that must be patched
before use.  These inconveniences will be fixed in the GoodFET11.
</p>

<h2>CAD Files</h2>

<p>Eagle CAD 5.x files for the design can be found in 
/branches/goodfet10 of Subversion, or as
<a href="/releases/goodfet10.zip">goodfet10.zip</a>.</p>

<p>Also, one 47K through-hole resistor and a 32.768kHz crystal
are required to patch errata.</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>Construct
as described on the

following Flickr image's annotations</a>, then patch as described
in the Errata section.

The GOODFET10 is missing a 47K pull-up resistor on the !RST pin of the MSP430F161x
chip.  Solder one like so.</p>

<p>Further, no crystals are present on this board.  A 32.768kHz crystal must be
patched onto the XIN/XOUT pins.</p>

<p>The board as first manufactured was too thin, so a wedge or a crimped
USB extension cable is necessary for a tight fit.  Future runs will be made
at 0.078'' thickness.</p>
