<p>The Api-Mote base is a hybrid device designed by rmspeers specifically for low-level interaction
with the IEEE 802.15.4 and Zigbee radio protocols. It also supports typical 
GoodFET activities via a GoodFET header. It's similar to the TelosB/Tmote in
design, but updated chips and more expansion options.</p>

<p><strong>See the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zigbee-security/wiki/ApiMote_Overview">Api-Do project</a> site for full documentation.</strong></p>

<h2>Building</h2>

<p>Build and flash firmware with the following commands.  The
$board variable must be set whenever the client is used, and the
device will not function without it.</p>

<pre>export board=apimote1
make clean install
goodfet.ccspi info
</pre>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Given the similarity to the TelosB, a few nifty examples are covered in the
article <a href="http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.com/2011/03/goodfet-on-telosb-tmote-sky.html">GoodFET
on the TelosB, TMote Sky</a>. Specifically, the device is good for
802.15.4 packet sniffing and injection, as well as for the quick
prototyping of new
applications.  <a href="http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/">Scapy</a>
802.15.4 layer integration (scapy-com repository dot15d4.py by rmspeers) also allows for packet dissection.</p>
