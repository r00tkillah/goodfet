<p>A stable release is available from
the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/goodfet/files/">Sourceforge
download page</a>.  While these releases are made every few weeks,
they do tend to become outdated and following the subversion feed is
the preferred method of keeping up to date with the project. <br />
</a></p>

<p>Firmware can be updated to the dist version with 
<i>goodfet.bsl --fromweb</i> on Linux and <i>gfbsl.exe --fromweb</i>
on Windows with the GNU Utilities for Windows.

<p>As a third choice, you may follow the subversion feed.  Every commit ought to
work, but no guarantee is made as to its reliability or safety.
