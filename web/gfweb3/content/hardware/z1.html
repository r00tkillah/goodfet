<p>The Zolertia Z1 is a modernized replacement for
the <a href="/hardware/telosb/">Telos B</a>, using a more modern
MSP430 and a different USB chip but being otherwise nearly identical.
Most importantly, the Z1 is available for order at
the <a href="http://www.zolertia.com/ti">Zolertia</a> website.
</p>

<h2>Building</h2>

<p>Build and flash firmware with the following commands.  The
$board variable must be set whenever the client is used, and the
device will not function without it.</p>

<pre>export board=z1
make clean install
goodfet.ccspi info
goodfet.spiflash info
</pre>

<h2>Schematics</h2>

<p>Schematics and documentation can be found
at <a href="http://www.zolertia.com/ti">http://www.zolertia.com/ti</a>
along with ordering information and expansion boards.
</p>

<!-- CAD Files would go here, but we didn't make the board. -->

<!-- Bill of Materials, Construction -->


<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>The Z1 has only been tested with the GoodFET in Linux.  Mac and
Windows compatibility have not yet been verified.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>A few nifty examples for the related Telos B board are covered in
the
article <a href="http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.com/2011/03/goodfet-on-telosb-tmote-sky.html">GoodFET
on the TelosB, TMote Sky</a>.  Specifically, the device is good for
802.15.4 packet sniffing and injection, as well as for the quick
prototyping of new
applications.  <a href="http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/">Scapy</a>
integration also allows for packet dissection.</p>
