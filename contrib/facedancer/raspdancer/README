Status:
=======
    Code tested successfully with the Raspdancer11. 
Raspdancer11 PCB not tested yet. Raspdancer11 prototype successfully tested. 
Raspdancer21 PCB not tested yet, design not tested.

Rationale:
==========
    Facedancer11 and Facedancer21 are one-purpose versions of the flexible
GoodFET board. It was well designed to move all the intelligence into the host
controller, not in the embedded uC. Therefore GoodFET part of the Facedancer
designs can be seen as "just" a SPI over UART over USB bridge.
But Raspberry Pi has a native SPI support so let's make dedicated versions.
It's cheaper (you save FT232RL & MSP430F2618TPM).
It's faster (SPI communication with MAX3420E/MAX3421E gets boosted to 26MHz!).
It still uses the same GoodFETMAXUSB.py library.

Construction & components:
==========================
    See pcb/ for Eagle files.
Many thanks to Jean-Christophe Nicaise for the initial Eagle design
and Zac Franken for his many good advices.

Name   Package    Description
------ -------    -----------
U1     LQFP32-08  MAX3420E*                    (* for facedancer11)
U1     TQPF32-5MM MAX3421E**                   (**for facedancer21)
R1     0603       33R USB Serie Resistor
R2     0603       33R USB Serie Resistor
C1     0603       1.0µF Capacitor
C2     0603       0.1µF Decoupling Capacitor
C3     0603       18pF Capacitor
C4     0603       18pF Capacitor
C5     0603       1.0µF Capacitor
Q1     5x3.2      12MHz SMD Crystal, 18pF      (see notes)
USB    USB Mini   Receptacle e.g. UX60-MB-5ST
USB2   USB A      USB-A SMT CONN Receptacle**  (**for facedancer21)
J_RASP 2x13       Receptacle, 2.54mm, 26way    (see notes)

Differences with original Facedancer11/21 (besides removal of GoodFET parts):
* smaller crystal package
* 2x13 connector towards RPi, e.g. a SAMTEC BCS-113-L-D-TE, or even a smaller
  one as 2x6 is enough, but then be the sure to plug the board correctly
  into the larger RPi connector!
* pads on the USB line, in case you want to solder directly a USB cable on it.
* Jumper to allow powering the RPi over this USB but beware:
  You're fuzzing the one which is powering you,
  don't cry if you experience power losses...
  RPi polyfuse is bypassed but power from a *real* USB port should be fine.
* Jumper to allow connecting INT to GPIO24 in case it gets used in the future
* Jumper to allow connecting GPX to GPIO23 in case it gets used in the future

Software:
=========
    Things have been done to be able to reuse the MAXUSB python libraries
written for facedancer. All you need is to replace the original GoodFET.py
by the version provided here. It relies on SPI and GPIO libraries, see below.
Code has to be run as root or user with enough rights on SPI & GPIO.

Activating SPI on Raspberry PI
------------------------------
Edit /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf and comment this line then reboot:
 #blacklist spi-bcm2708

Python SPI library for Raspberry Pi
-----------------------------------
We're using this one:
https://github.com/lthiery/SPI-Py (tested with commit b2c7854c, 2013-04-15)
 wget https://raw.github.com/lthiery/SPI-Py/master/spi.c
 wget https://raw.github.com/lthiery/SPI-Py/master/setup.py
 apt-get install python2.7-dev
 python setup.py build
 Result spi.so is in build/lib.linux-armv6l-2.7/, to be dropped in python path

Python GPIO library for Raspberry Pi
------------------------------------
We're using this one:
https://code.google.com/p/raspberry-gpio-python/
We tested the version v0.4.1a-1 which is pre-installed on Raspbian
