<h1>GoodFET24</h1>

<p>The GoodFET24 is the fourteenth hardware revision of the GoodFET,
owing its heritage to the <a href="/hardware/goodfet41/">GoodFET41</a>
and the unreleased GoodFET23.  As it is designed for timing-sensitive
tasks, there is a crystal reference clock for each MSP430.  (The two
do not share a clock because it is useful to have them be out of phase
with one another.)
</p>

<p><b>N.B. This model does not yet have software support, and might
contain mistakes that will require significant design changes.  Unless
you really know what you're doing, build
the <a href="/hardware/goodfet41/">GoodFET41</a> instead.</b></p>

<h2>CAD Files</h2>

<p>Eagle CAD 5.x files for the design can be found in
/branches/goodfet24 of the subversion repository, or as
<a href="/releases/goodfet24.zip">goodfet24.zip</a>.</p>

<h2>Bill of Materials</h2>

<p>The MSP430F2618TPM may be replaced with a 2617, 2619, 2247, 2248,
or 2249 chip.  Similarly, the MSP430F2001 may be replaced with other
MSP430 chips in that same package.</p>

<p>Resistor values can be approximated.  Be sure to get the 64 pin
variant of the MSP430F2618, as 80-pin versions are also manufactured.</p>
