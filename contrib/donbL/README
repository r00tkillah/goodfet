# goal
#
 - develop a simple bootloader for use on the AVR architecture
 - primarily to be used with the AVR port of the GoodFET project
	- http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/

# notes
#
 - is less than 2048 bytes in size (1024 words)
 - programs BOOTRST, so the NRWW section always executes first
 - expects a 20MHz external clock
 - not security hardened, not tested on AVR security-robust chips
 - interrupts will be managed from the BL in the future
	- applications may register vectors with the BL
