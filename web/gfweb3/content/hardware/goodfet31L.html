<h1>GoodFET31L</h1>

<p>Resulting from a collaboration between Scott Livingston and Travis
Goodspeed, the GoodFET31L derives from the GoodFET31 and uses QFN
variants of MSP430F2274 and FT232R chips. Discrete components remain
unchanged in size and value (see Bill of Materials below).</p>

<p>The end of the board opposite to the USB pads is designed to fit
in-between the two rows of 6x2 0.1" pin header. The fit should be snug,
and each pin is soldered to the pad in the style of SMD work. A more
detailed construction demonstration for side-mounting the 0.1" header
and soldering QFN chips may be done in the (near) future.</p>

<h2>CAD Files</h2>

<p>Eagle CAD 5.x files for the design can be found in
/branches/goodfet31L of the subversion repository, or as
<a href="/releases/goodfet31L.zip">goodfet31L.zip</a>.</p>
