<h1>GoodFET41</h1>

<p>The GoodFET41 is the thirteenth hardware revision of the GoodFET,
owing its heritage to
the <a href="/hardware/goodfet40/">GoodFET40</a>.  It retains most of
that model's design while being manufactured on a thicker board for
stability and adding a Spy-Bi-Wire connector for compatibility with
eZ430 target boards.
</p>

<h2>CAD Files</h2>

<p>Eagle CAD 5.x files for the design can be found in
/branches/goodfet41 of the subversion repository, or as
<a href="/releases/goodfet41.zip">goodfet41.zip</a>.</p>

<h2>Bill of Materials</h2>

<p>The MSP430F2618TPM may be replaced with a 2617, 2619, 2417, 2418,
or 2419 chip.</p>

<p>Resistor values can be approximated.  Be sure to get the 64 pin
variant of the MSP430F2618, as 80-pin versions are also manufactured.</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>Please the components as shown the comments to this Flickr image.
As this is a surface-mount design, be sure that you are familiar with
such techniques or have assistance before beginning assembly.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Build and flash firmware with the following commands.  This board
self-flashes over USB through a masked-ROM bootloader, so there is no
need for an external programmer.</p>

<pre>export board=goodfet41
make clean install
goodfet.monitor info
</pre>

<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>Nothing yet.</p>
