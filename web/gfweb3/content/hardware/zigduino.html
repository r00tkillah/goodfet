<h1>Zigduino (r1)</h1>


<p>
The <a href="http://logos-electro.com/zigduino-r1/">Zigduino r1</a> is
an Arduino-like and Arduino-compatible platform that contains an Atmel
atmega128rfa1 microcontroller that hasan integrated IEEE 802.15.4
radio. It was developed by Logos Electromechanical LLC.  Unfortunately
the Zigduino r1 is not for sale anymore.  Logos Electromechanical, now
offers a
new-and-improved <a href="http://logos-electro.com/zigduino-r2/">Zigduino
r2</a> that uses the same microcontroller.  GoodFET has not yet been
tested on the Zigduino r2.
</p>

<h2>Building</h2>

<p>Build and flash firmware with the following commands.  The $board
variable must be set whenever the client is used, and the device will
not function without it.  Installation of this firmware requires
avrdude to be install</p>

<pre>export board=zigduino
make clean avrinstall
</pre>

<h2>Schematics</h2>

<p>Schematics for the Zigduino r1 can be found on <a href="http://logos-electro.com/documentation/zigduino/zigduino-r1/zigduino-v5-schematic.pdf">Logos Electromechanical's website</a> [pdf].
</p>


<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Basic packet sniffing and transmitting tools are implemented in the zigduino's client code, <a href="/clients/goodfetzigduino/">goodfet.zigduino</a>.
The device is good for
802.15.4 packet sniffing and injection, as well as for the quick
prototyping of new
applications.  <a href="http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/">Scapy</a>
integration also allows for packet crafting and dissection.</p>
