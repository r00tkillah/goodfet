<h1>Monitor Application</h1>

<p>This application manages local memory, providing access to peripherals
and the GoodFET's global configuration.</p>

<h2>Clients</h2>

<p>All clients deal with the monitor in some way.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>The monitor provides access to the local memory of the GoodFET device,
and it ought to be used to debug the unit or poke pieces of memory directly.
Additionally, it might serve as a standalone bootloader with a few tweaks
to the IVT.</p>

<h2>Verbs</h2>

<p>The following verbs are supported.</p>

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Hex</th><th>#define</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>0x02</td><td>PEEK</td><td>Read word from memory at word[0].</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x03</td><td>POKE</td><td>Write word[1] to memory at word[0]. (Not flash.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x80</td><td>CHANGE_BAUD</td><td>Change the baud rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x90</td><td>RAM_PATTERN</td><td>Suicide, filling RAM with a pattern.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x91</td><td>RAM_DEPTH</td><td>Determine heap/stack depth.</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<h3>CHANGE_BAUD (0x80)</h3>

<p>The GoodFET defaults to 9600 baud, but alternate baud rates are
available by use of the CHANGE_BAUD (0x80) command of the Monitor
application.  This takes a single byte, which specifies the baud rate
as per the following table.</p>

<p><b>N.B.,</b> This command does not generate a reply.</p>

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Byte</th><th>Value</th></tr>
<tr><td>0x00</td><td>Default (115200)</tr>
<tr><td>0x01</td><td>9600</tr>
<tr><td>0x02</td><td>19200</tr>
<tr><td>0x03</td><td>38400</tr>
<tr><td>0x04</td><td>57600</tr>
<tr><td>0x05</td><td>115200</tr>
</table>
</p>

<h3>RAM_PATTERN (0x90)</h3>

<p>Fill all of RAM with 0xBEEF, then reset to begin the firmware from
the start.  Unless power is lost, this pattern will only be
overwritten by the firmware's use of RAM and the bootloader's caching
of write blocks.</p>

<p>The GoodFET will reboot after sending a reply.  It is recommended
that the client session reset as well.</p>

<h3>RAM_DEPTH (0x91)</h3>

<p>Measures the size of the 0xBEEF block in the middle of RAM,
calculating from that the amount of RAM which has been used by the
firmware.  Running RAM_PATTERN, then several test cases, followed by
RAM_DEPTH, will allow the RAM requirements of the application to be
accurately estimated.</p>
