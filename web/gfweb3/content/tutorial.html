<h1>GoodFET Tutorials</h1>

<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>Construct your GoodFET using the components listed in its Hardware page.  As of
March 2010, you probably want a GoodFET3x for embedded systems
development or a GoodFET2x for voltage glitching security research.
All previous models are still supported by the programming
software.</p>

<!--jbest: finally added the construction tutorial. March 2010-->
<p>If you are new to surface mount components, start <a href=/construction/>here</a>.</p>

<h3>Verification</h3>

<p>If your GoodFET is properly assembled, you should see a notice in
dmesg that an FTDI USB/Serial adapter has been added on insertion of
the device.  The device name varies with operating system, but it's probably
one of /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyU0, or /dev/tty/cu.usbserial-*.</p>

<p>You should also see the RX/TX LEDs blink briefly when inserting the
device.  If they do not, their polarity is likely wrong and you will
need to desolder and rotate them.  For those without an SMD rework
station, it might be easier to burn the LEDs off and apply fresh
ones.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>Until a first version of the GoodFET software is released, you will
need to track the project by svn.  This makes upgrading a breeze, but
you will not be able to install the software by your favorite Linux
distribution's package manager.</p>

<p>Running the following commands will download the latest version
of the project to ~/svn/goodfet and link the client scripts into
/usr/local/bin/.  Optionally, you may add the client directory to
your $PATH if you do not have sudo privileges.</p>

<p><pre>mkdir ~/svn
cd ~/svn
svn co https://goodfet.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/goodfet
cd goodfet/trunk/client
sudo make link
</pre><br/></p>

<p><i>(TODO: Describe the installation of prerequisite packages
such as Gnuplot-py, py-sqlite3, py-serial, etc here.)</i></p>

<p>Now that the software is installed, dump the info flash of your
GoodFET to a text file for safekeeping.  This information is destroyed
when flashing the device, and in the rare even that it is needed, it
is very handy to have.  If you have the time, it would be nice to
email a copy of this file to Travis Goodspeed &lt;travis at
radiantmachines.com&gt;.</p>

<p><pre>goodfet.bsl --dumpinfo &gt;infoflash.txt
</pre><br/></p>

<p>Once this backup has been made, you can use goodfet.bsl to install
a recent version of the firmware from the Internet.  This is faster
than building the firmware from scratch, which is described in the
next session.</p>

<p><pre>goodfet.bsl --fromweb
goodfet.monitor test
</pre><br/></p>

<h3>Firmware</h3>

<p>There are two ways to get the firmware.  By far the fastest is to
use the web version by 'goodfet.bsl --fromweb', but participation in
development of the project will require you to build it from
scratch.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://mspgcc.sourceforge.net/">mspgcc</a> compiler is
preferred for the project.  Binary packages are hard to find, if they
exist at all.  If you are running Linux, I suggest you follow 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/mspgcc/index.php?title=Linux_installation#Building_from_Source">
the build instructions found in the mspgcc wiki.</a>  The instructions
have been verified to work on Debian 5 (Lenny) as of January 9, 2011.
The build instructions will result in the toolchain being installed in
a folder named /opt/mspgcc.  You must add /opt/mspgcc/bin to your PATH
environment variable before you can build the firmware.

NOTE: There appears to be a newer version of the mspgcc toolchain
located in the <a href="http://mspgcc4.sourceforge.net/">mspgcc4</a>
project.  However, after building mspgcc4 from source on my Debian 5
(Lenny) machine, it was able to build the firmware, but it did not
successfully run on my GoodFET board.

If you are using Windows, the mspgcc sourceforge page has pre-built
binary installers for Windows.
