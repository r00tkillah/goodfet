GoodFET31L - miniaturized GoodFET31 board

We present a board derived from the GoodFET31 and using QFN variants
of MSP430F2274 and FT232R chips. Discrete components remain unchanged
in size and value, i.e. you should still use 0603 caps, resistors and
LEDs. Port 4 is no longer broken out.

Nota bene, board thickness is still 0.078"

The end of the board opposite to the USB pads is designed to fit
in-between the two rows of 6x2 0.1" header. The fit should be snug,
and each pin is soldered to the pad in the style of SMD work. A more
detailed construction demonstration for side-mounting the 0.1" header
and soldering QFN chips may be done in the (near) future.
