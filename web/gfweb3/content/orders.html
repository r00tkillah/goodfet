<p>Be sure to include a properly formatted shipping address; a
properly formatted address includes a full name and carriage
returns. You will need to separately purchase parts from the Bill of
Materials.</p>

<p>As this price is slightly above cost, we are happy to offer free
boards to students, the unemployed, and the funemployed.  Just send an
email to the same address, and some boards will reach you in a jiffy.
This offer also applied to larger orders intended for group workshops
or hackerspaces.  Please <b>do not</b> send us proof of such status,
as we Tennesseans don't believe in checking papers.</p>

<p>Shipping to other countries is no trouble on our end, but they
might be a problem on yours.  In particular, shipments to Germany and
Australia are often delayed by customs.  If you'd prefer a private
carrier, such as Fedex, just ask for that and Paypal us the cost.</p>

<p>While we prefer Paypal (sixtysixav at hotmail.com) in USD, we
accept payment in any currency, including but not limited to
Confederate Dollars, Bitcoin (1GV3mhfg3dQ4qaH5oCTVoAnfYNmsYjkAEw),
IOU, ale, hops, socks with hops, Krugerrands, Hungarian Pengo.  Please
be honest about the exchange rate.</p>
