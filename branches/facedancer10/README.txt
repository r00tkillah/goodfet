Facedancer10, a GoodFET for exploiting USB.
by Travis Goodspeed and Sergey Bratus

The Facedancer board exposes a MAX3420 USB device controller to
Python, allowing a good neighbor to explore the vulnerabilities of
poorly written USB device drivers, prototype USB devices, or otherwise
play with USB as a network instead of as a magic school bus.

The MAX3420E part in active.lbr came from a tutorial by Andrew Greensted.
