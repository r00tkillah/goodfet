The following are informal notes about py-bluez support.


1) Linux

   With py-bluez installed, you should be able to set GOODFET=bluetooth
   to scan for devices and GOODFET=aa:bb:cc:11:22:33 to connect to
   a specific device.

2) Mac

   At present, py-bluez isn't functional on OS X.  As such, users will
   need to stick to the FTDI variant or run the client from within VMWare.
   Linux in VMWare offers decent Bluetooth support.

3) N900

   The regular client runs on the N900 with py-bluez.  If a particular
   port requires py-serial, that's a bug which can easily be patched
   by removing the import.

4) Android

   A port to Python for Android is in progress, to be distributed as a
   .egg archive with hands-off example scripts.  Until then, it is
   likely best to run the command-line version through a chrooted
   Debian installation.
