This is a sandbox for figuring out a port of the GoodFET firmware to
the Arduino.  In particular, I'm interested in the Freakduino which
contains an AT86RF230 radio.  Having 5V support couldn't be bad either.

The Arduino will remain a secondary target, and I don't expect to move
the default hardware from MSP430 to AVR.
