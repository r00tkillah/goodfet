<h1>Ordering</h1>

<h3>GoodFET31</h3>
<p>The <a href="/hardware/goodfet31">GoodFET31</a> PCB is available by sending USD $5/board to
sixtysixav at hotmail.com.  Be sure to include a shipping address, and note that you
will also need to purchase parts from the <a href="/hardware/goodfet31">Bill of Materials</a>.
</p>

<p>As this price is slightly above cost, we are happy to offer free boards to students,
the unemployed, and the funemployed.  Just send an email to the same address, and some
boards will reach you in a jiffy.</p>

<p>Shipping to Europe, Canada, and Mexico is not a problem.</p>

<h3>GoodFET22</h3>

<p>For voltage glitching research, the GoodFET22 is a better option.  Email travis at
radiantmachines.com for a few of these if they are still in stock.</p>
