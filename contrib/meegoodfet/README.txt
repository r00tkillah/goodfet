This is a quick hack of GoodFET client for Meego, used for my personal
wardriving of Zigbee networks.  It has no warranty, expressed or
implied, and I'm not supporting it.  Do whatever you like with this
code under whatever license (including BSD or GPL), but cite your
sources and buy me a beer if you find it handy.

Happy hacking,
