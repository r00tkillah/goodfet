<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h3>BSL</h3>

<p><i>What does ``Verb FF is wrong.  Incorrect firmware or bad Info guess?'' mean?</i><br/>
See Travis Goodspeed's blog post on the
<a href="http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.com/2009/10/msp430-info-flash.html">MSP430
Info Flash</a> for a full explanation of how the GoodFET guesses at timing
values when no crystal is available.  The default values ought to work for
most models, but when they don't work you will get this error message.
To get around this, run ``goodfet.bsl -e -p $foo; goodfet.bsl -p
<a href="http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/dist/">goodfet.hex</a>'' for each *.txt
in contrib/infos of the subversion repository.
</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>

<p><i>Which model do I want?</i><br/>
The GoodFET2x boards provide support for analog voltage glitching, a rather difficult
technique which can expose the firmware of some microcontrollers by bypassing the
fuse check.  If you do not need this feature, the GoodFET3x series is a lot easier to
solder and runs the same firmware.</p>

<p><i>Do I use a 47K pull-up resistor or a 74K resistor for the !RST line?</i><br/>
74K is a typo, but anything from 1K to 100K ought to work.  The !RST pull-up
resistor has been removed from recent models, and it can probably be omitted
in older models.</p>

<p><i>I would like a GoodFET, but I am unable to solder.  Will you send me an assembled
unit?</i><br/>
Unless you are willing to pay an absurd markup, it is best to build your own.  Bring
the components to your local <a href="http://hackerspaces.org">hackerspace</a>, and
ask a neighbor to help you out.</p>

<h3>Distribution</h3>

<p><i>What license does this project use?  Can I fork it, package it, or trade
it for battle umbrellas?</i><br/>
The GoodFET firmware and client software are 3-clause BSD licensed, and you are free to
redistribute anything in the GoodFET repository without any unneighborly
restrictions.</p>

<p><i>Where can I get the latest version of the code?</i><br/>
svn co https://goodfet.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/goodfet
</p>

<p><i>Is a zip archive available that's just a little more stable</i><br/>
<a href="http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/dist/goodfet.zip">http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/dist/goodfet.zip</a>
</p>

<p><i>Is there a version for Windows?</i><br/>  Yes, but it is very
new.
Download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/goodfet/files/">GFWin.zip</a>
and be sure that you have
the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf&displaylang=en">Visual
Studio Redistribution Package</a>.
</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p><i>Will the client run on my operating system?</i><br/>
While the software is developed in unix, you ought to be able to run it
under Windows with Cygwin and Python.</p>

<p><i>Which python packages are required?</i><br/>
python-serial, python-sqlite</p>

<p><i>Where do I get MSPGCC?</i><br/>
For OpenBSD, Linux, and Darwin, precompiled versions of mspgcc can be found
<a href="http://goodserv.cis.upenn.edu/mspgcc/">here</a>.  The TinyOS builds
are too dated, and they cannot compile the GoodFET firmware reliably.</p>

<p><i>Can I install the firmware without MSPGCC?</i><br/>
Sure.  'goodfet.bsl --fromweb' will download the most recent firmware from
the website.</p>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p><i>Would you like patches for the $foo architecture?</i><br/>
Yes!  Email travis at radiantmachines.com or join us in #goodfet
on Freenode to discuss it.</p>

<p><i>Will you write support for $foo?</i><br/>
There's a long queue of chips to support.  Getting pushed to the front
won't be easy.</p>

<p><i>Who builds the GoodFET?</i><br/>
The project was begun by <a href="http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.com/">Travis
Goodspeed</a> in early 2009.  Other neighbors contribute regularly.</p>

<p><i>Can the firmware be ported?</i><br/>
Yes.  Ports are underway for the <a href="http://zolertia.sourceforge.net/">Zolertia Z1</a>,
Telos B, and other MSP430 devices.  In the longer term, a port is planned to the
Chipcon 8051 radios.</p>
