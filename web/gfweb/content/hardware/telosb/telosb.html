<p>The Telos B is a wireless sensor development platform which is also
sold as a MoteIV TMote Sky.  While the hardware predates the GoodFET
project, the two share many design similarities, allowing a port
with little trouble.
</p>

<h2>Building</h2>

<p>Build and flash firmware with the following commands.  The
$platform variable must be set whenever the client is used, and the
device will not function without it.</p>

<pre>export platform=telosb
export mcu=msp430x1611
export config='monitor ccspi spi'
make clean install
goodfet.ccspi info
goodfet.spiflash info</pre>

<!-- CAD Files would go here, but we didn't make the board. -->

<!-- Bill of Materials, Construction -->


<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>The <a href="/clients/goodfet.spiflash/">goodfet.spiflash</a>
client cannot determine the size or model of the SPI Flash chip in the
TMote Sky, whose chip differs somehow from the otherwise identical
Telos B.  Reads, writes, and erases perform as expected.</p>
