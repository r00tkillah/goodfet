<h2>Clients</h2>

<p>Please write one.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>Prior to any transaction, the SETUP (0x10) verb should be sent to the
I2C application to properly set the I/O directions and values.
The START (0x20), STOP (0x21), READ (0x00), and WRITE (0x01) verbs are used
for transactions, with WRITE returning the acknowledge bit.</p>

<p>Please note that I2C application has yet to be tested.  This should be
completed by June 17 at the latest.</p>
