<h1>Facedancer21</h1>

<p>The Facedancer21 is the twenty-fourth hardware revision of the
GoodFET, owing its heritage to
the <a href="/hardware/goodfet41/">GoodFET41</a>
and <a href="/hardware/facedancer20/">Facedancer20</a>.  Unlike the
general-purpose GoodFET boards, the only purpose of this board is to
allow USB devices to be written in host-side Python, so that one
workstation can fuzz-test the USB device drivers of another host.
This board replaces the MAX3420E of earlier Facedancers with a
MAX3421E, allowing for optional host mode through a USB A receptacle.
</p>

<p>See the <a href="/orders/">Orders</a> page for details on ordering
PCBs.  Assembled boards are not yet available.</p>

<h2>CAD Files</h2>

<p>Eagle CAD 6.x files for the design can be found in
/branches/facedancer21 of the GoodFET subversion repository, or along
with gerbers as
<a href="/releases/facedancer21.zip">facedancer21.zip</a>.</p>

<h2>Bill of Materials</h2>

<p>The MSP430F2618TPM may be replaced with a 2617, 2619, 2417, 2418,
or 2419 chip, provided that the $mcu variable is set.</p>

<p>Resistor values can be approximated, and the 1.0&mu;F capacitors
are probably unneeded.  Be sure to get the 64 pin variant of the
MSP430F2618, as 80-pin versions are also manufactured.

<p>* These should match the required capacitance of the crystal.  18pF is wrong, but close enough to work.</p>
<p>** The /US SMD package works as an alternative.</p>

<p>If you need help selecting parts, you can follow
this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/10g7f0/goodfetfacedancer_parts_list/">example
Digi-Key order</a>, but be sure to replace the MAX3420 with a MAX3421.
You will also need the USB Type A receptacle for Host Mode.</p>


<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>Place the components as shown in the comments of this Flickr image.
As this is a surface-mount design, be sure that you are familiar with
such techniques or have assistance before beginning assembly.  See the
errata section for details on where to run fly-wires, as two pins
were not connected in the PCB layout.</p>

Tutorial</a> for more detailed explanations.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Build and flash firmware with the following commands.  This board
self-flashes over USB through a masked-ROM bootloader, so there is no
need for an external programmer.</p>

<p><pre>export board=facedancer21
make clean install
goodfet.maxusbhid
</pre></p>

<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>None, we hope!</p>
