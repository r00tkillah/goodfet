/* On the XScale chip, the TDI pin is connected to the MSB of the IR and the 
 * TDO is connected to the LSB.  That means we have to shift these commands 
 * in from LSB to MSB order. */

/* 01000 - High Z
 * The highz instruction floats all three-stateable output and in/out pins. 
 * Also, when this instruction is active, the Bypass register is connected 
 * between TDI and TDO. This register can be accessed via the JTAG Test-Access 
 * Port throughout the device operation. Access to the Bypass register can also 
 * be obtained with the bypass instruction. */

/* 11110 - Get ID Code
 * The idcode instruction is used in conjunction with the device identification 
 * register. It connects the identification register between TDI and TDO in the 
 * Shift_DR state. When selected, idcode parallel-loads the hard-wired 
 * identification code (32 bits) on TDO into the identification register on the 
 * rising edge of TCK in the Capture_DR state. Note: The device identification 
 * register is not altered by data being shifted in on TDI.*/
#define XSCALE_IR_IDCODE			0x1E

/* 11111 - Bypass
 * The bypass instruction selects the Bypass register between TDI and TDO pins 
 * while in SHIFT_DR state, effectively bypassing the processorâ€™s test logic. 
 * 02 is captured in the CAPTURE_DR state. While this instruction is in effect, 
 * all other test data registers have no effect on the operation of the system. 
 * Test data registers with both test and system functionality perform their 
 * system functions when this instruction is selected. */
