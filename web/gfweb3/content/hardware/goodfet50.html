<h1>GoodFET50</h1>

<p>The GoodFET50 is the fourteenth hardware revision of the GoodFET,
roughly owing its heritage to the
<a href="/hardware/goodfet40/">GoodFET40</a>.  However, it is a completely new
design; about the only thing that stayed was the 14-pin connector and 3 LEDs.
The FT232R is gone, and the MSP430F2618 has ben replaced by an MS430F5510.
Further, the mini-USB connector has been replaced by micro USB (I have a ton of
those cables lying around, but can never find mini-USB). The end result is the
cheapest board yet, at roughly $4 of components total, and also the most
flexible (the USB interface is on the MSP430, allowing us to interface with
Android 3.1 devices with host mode)</p>

<p><b>Note that while this is probably the final hardware rev, the
software has not yet been ported. Working software should be ready by
early October 2011.  Boards will not be stocked until then.</b></p>

<h2>CAD Files</h2>

<p>
<p>gEDA/PCB (not Eagle) files for the design can be found in
/branches/goodfet50 of the subversion repository, or as
<a href="/releases/goodfet50.zip">goodfet50.zip</a>.</p>

<h2>Bill of Materials</h2>

<p>The MSP430F5510PT may be replaced with a 5508 or 5509.</p>

<p>Resistor values can be approximated.</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>Please the components as shown the comments to this Flickr image.
As this is a surface-mount design, be sure that you are familiar with
such techniques or have assistance before beginning assembly.</p>

<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>In the event that the wire to pin 14 breaks when separating boards and you need pin 14, there's a nearby via to which a separate wire can be soldered.</p>
