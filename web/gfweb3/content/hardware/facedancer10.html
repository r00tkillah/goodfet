<h1>Facedancer10</h1>

<p>The Facedancer10 is the fourteenth hardware revision of the
GoodFET, owing its heritage to
the <a href="/hardware/goodfet41/">GoodFET41</a>.  Unlike the
general-purpose GoodFET boards, the only purpose of this board is to
allow USB devices to be written in host-side Python, so that one
workstation can fuzz-test the USB device drivers of another host.
</p>

<p><i>N.B.: This device is still being prototyped.  At present, the
firmware is functional but the hardware has not yet been
finalized.</i></p>

<h2>CAD Files</h2>

<p>Eagle CAD 5.x files for the design can be found in
/branches/facedancer10 of the subversion repository, or as
<a href="/releases/facedancer10.zip">facedancer10.zip</a>.</p>

<h2>Bill of Materials</h2>

<p>The MSP430F2618TPM may be replaced with a 2617, 2619, 2417, 2418,
or 2419 chip, provided that the $mcu variable is set.</p>

<p>Resistor values can be approximated.  Be sure to get the 64 pin
variant of the MSP430F2618, as 80-pin versions are also manufactured.</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>Place the components as shown in the comments of this Flickr image.
As this is a surface-mount design, be sure that you are familiar with
such techniques or have assistance before beginning assembly.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Build and flash firmware with the following commands.  This board
self-flashes over USB through a masked-ROM bootloader, so there is no
need for an external programmer.</p>

<pre>export board=facedancer10
make clean install
goodfet.maxusbhid
</pre>

<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>Nothing yet.  Hopefully it'll stay that way!</p>
