<h1>PIC Application</h1>

<p>Read, program, erase <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontroller">PIC</a> chips. Originally targetted at 16-bit families (i.e., PIC24H, dsPIC33F, PIC24F, and dsPIC30F), but now moving in the 8-bit and 32-bit directions.</p>

<p>Pinout is
<table border="1">
<tr><th>GoodFET pin</th><th>PIC ICSP pin</th></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>PGD</td><tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>!MCLR</td><tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>PGC</td><tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Vcc</td><tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>GND</td><tr>
</table>
</p>

<h2>Clients</h2>

goodfet.pic is a decent but unstable client. You can expect its
command-line arguments to change as new chip families become
supported and as the PIC app evolves.

A Python class that subsumes goodfet.pic (whereby goodfet.pic will
become a mere frontend to several methods of the class) is in the
works. Stay tuned.

<h2>Development</h2>

Coming soon!

<h2>Verbs</h2>

<p>The following verbs are supported. Note that the standard verbs are
currently <em>not</em> implemented in their < 0x80 address
(confer <a href="/manual/">the manual</a>). The PIC app is still young
and, given variations in access methods across chip families, it is not
ready to commit to standard verbs.</p>

<p>Naming conventions:
<ul>
<li>*33F - targets PIC24H and dsPIC33F chips.</li>
</ul></p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Hex</th><th>#define</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>0x81</td><td>PIC_DEVID33F</td><td>Read Device ID, application ID, and hardware revision.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x82</td><td>PIC_SIX33F</td><td>ICSP six command; execute instruction on target (sourcing clock from PGC).</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x83</td><td>PIC_REGOUT33F</td><td>Read out VISI register.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x84</td><td>PIC_START33F</td><td>Start ICSP session.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x85</td><td>PIC_STOP33F</td><td>Stop ICSP session (basically, drop !MCLR pin and pause briefly).</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x86</td><td>PIC_SIXLIST33F</td><td>Buffer list of instructions to MSP430, then execute them over ICSP session with target dsPIC33F/PIC24H chip. This reduces overhead of UART communication between client and app.</td></tr>
