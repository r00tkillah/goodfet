<h1>GoodThopter10</h1>

<p>The GoodThopter10 is a sexy GoodFET CAN device based around the design
of the <a href="/hardware/goodfet31/">GoodFET31</a>. Unlike the general-
purpose GoodFET boards, the purpose of this board is to be used in the
exploration of Automotive communication buses, currently supporting only
the CAN bus. In addition to GF31 circuitry we have added a high-speed
CAN Transceiver (MCP2551) and a Stand-alone CAN Controller with a SPI
Interface (MCP2515).

<h2>CAD Files</h2>

<p>Eagle CAD 6.x files for the design can be found in
/branches/goodthopter10 of the GoodFET subversion repository, or along
with gerbers as
<a href="/releases/goodthopter10.zip">goodthopter10.zip</a>.</p>

<h2>Bill of Materials</h2>

<p>Resistor values can be approximated.</p>

<p>* These should match the required capacitance of the crystal.</p>
<p>** The /US SMD package works as an alternative.</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>Place the components as shown in the comments of this Flickr image.
As this is a surface-mount design, be sure that you are familiar with
such techniques or have assistance before beginning assembly.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/tutorial/">GoodFET
Tutorial</a> for more detailed explanations.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Build and flash firmware with the following commands.  This board
self-flashes over USB through a masked-ROM bootloader, so there is no
need for an external programmer.</p>

<p><pre>export board=goodthopter10
make clean install
goodfet.can info
</pre></p>

<h2>Errata</h2>

<h3>OBD2 Cable</h3>

<p>TODO: Fix this broken image.</p>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewrighter/8208572495/in/photostream" 
title="GoodThopter1x CAN Serial Pinout"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8062/8208572495_8fc716e9bc_n.jpg" width="320" height="179" 
alt="GoodThopter11 CAN"></a>

<p>The pinout of the GoodThopter1x series is above and since CANH and CANL is located on pins 7 and 2 (respectively) 
the cable you will want to choose is something like this
<a href="http://intrepidcs.com/osc_store/product_info.php/cPath/32/products_id/38"> one</a> and <b>not the Sparkfun model</b> which
has a different pinout for CANH,CANL. Apologies, I think in the future, if it makes sense we will design to the cheaper option after
we test both.</p>



<h3>MCP2551 Voltage</h3>
<p>The worst errata is the MCP2551 needs operating voltage between
4.5-5.5V. Right now it is connected to a 3.3V bus.</p>


<p>TODO: Replace this broken image.</p>

<p>The remaining layout issues don't seem to affect performance, but a
board cleanup is suggested for the GoodThopter11.</p>
