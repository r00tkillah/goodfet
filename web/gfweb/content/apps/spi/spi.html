<h1>SPI Application</h1>

<p>This application allows for the programming of chips by SPI,
the Serial Peripheral Interface.  Use the following pinout,
which is very similar to the JTAG pinout.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>Prior to any transactions, the SETUP (0x10) verb should be sent to the
SPI application to properly set the I/O directions.</p>

<p>SPI is based upon the exchange of information as a duplex transaction.
As such, the READ (0x00) and WRITE (0x01) verbs are identical.  Each transmits
the bytes of the data buffer through MOSI, returning the result through
MISO.  !SS is dropped low at the beginning of a transaction,
then raised after all bytes have been exchanged.</p>
