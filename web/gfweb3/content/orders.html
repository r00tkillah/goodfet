<h3>Circuit Boards</h3>

<p>PCBs for the <a href="/hardware/goodfet31">GoodFET31</a>
and <a href="/hardware/goodfet41">GoodFET41</a> are available by
sending USD $5/board to sixtysixav at hotmail.com.  Facedancer11
boards will be available starting 4 July.</p>

<p>Be sure to include a properly formatted shipping address, and note
that you will also need to purchase parts from the Bill of
Materials.</p>

<p>As this price is slightly above cost, we are happy to offer free
boards to students, the unemployed, and the funemployed.  Just send an
email to the same address, and some boards will reach you in a jiffy.
Please <b>do not</b> send us proof of such status, as we Tennesseans
don't believe in checking papers.</p>

<p>Shipping to other countries is no trouble on our end, but they
might be a problem on yours.  In particular, shipments to Germany and
Australia are often delayed by customs.  If you'd prefer a private
carrier, such as Fedex, just ask for that and Paypal us the cost.</p>

<h3>Assembled Boards</h3>

<p>Assembled GoodFETs are not yet available.  Please be patient.</p>
