<p>A stable release is always available at the following URL, which is uploaded
when all test cases pass.  At some point, one of these distributions
will become the first official release.<br />
<a href="http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/dist/goodfet.zip">
http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/dist/goodfet.zip</a></p>

<p>Similarly, the firmware can be updated to the dist version with 
<pre>goodfet.bsl --fromweb</pre>

<p>As a third choice, you may follow the subversion feed.  Every commit ought to
work, but no guarantee is made as to its reliability or safety.
