<h1>GoodFET42</h1>

<p>The GoodFET42 is the twenty-second hardware revision of the
GoodFET, owing its heritage to
the <a href="/hardware/goodfet41/">GoodFET41</a>.  It retains most of
that model's design but the layout has been redone and the expensive
Mill-Max connector has been dropped.
</p>

<h2>CAD Files</h2>

<p>Eagle CAD 5.x files for the design can be found in
/branches/goodfet42 of the subversion repository, or as
<a href="/releases/goodfet42.zip">goodfet42.zip</a>.</p>

<h2>Bill of Materials</h2>

<p>With a different firmware configuration, the MSP430F2618TPM could
be replaced with a 2617, 2619, 2417, 2418, or 2419 chip.</p>

<p>Resistor values can be approximated.  Be sure to get the 64 pin
variant of the MSP430F2618, as 80-pin versions are also
manufactured.</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>Please the components as shown the comments to this Flickr image.
As this is a surface-mount design, be sure that you are familiar with
such techniques or have assistance before beginning assembly.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Build and flash firmware with the following commands.  This board
self-flashes over USB through a masked-ROM bootloader, so there is no
need for an external programmer.</p>

<pre>export board=goodfet42
make clean install
goodfet.monitor info
</pre>

<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>Nothing yet.</p>
