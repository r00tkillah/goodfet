<h1>BadFET20</h1>

<p>The BadFET20 is the fourth hardware revision of the GoodFET, and it
shares a board with the <a href="/hardware/goodfet20/">GoodFET20</a>.
It differs from the GoodFET20 in that its microcontroller is a more
powerful MSP430F2618 running at 16MHz by an internal oscillator.</p>

<h2>CAD Files</h2>

<p>Eagle CAD 5.x files for the design can be found in
/branches/goodfet20 of the subversion repository, or as
<a href="/releases/goodfet20.zip">goodfet20.zip</a>.  The GoodFET20
and the BadFET20 use identical boards; they only differ in the choice
of components.

<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>Construct as described on the following Flickr image's annotations,
using a 2618 in lieu of the 1612.  Omit the row of pull-up resistors.

<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>The GoodFET20 documentation used to indicate that adding an 8MHz
crystal would suffice to convert a GoodFET to a BadFET.  That was
incorrect, and an MSP430F2618 is required.</p>

<p>Thanks to Kenny for reporting that the 47K pull-up resistor
was missing from the BOM.  This has since been corrected.</p>

<p>Most 74HC4053 chips do not function at 3.3V.  For glitching
research, please use the <a href="/hardware/goodfet21/">GoodFET21</a>
instead.</p>
