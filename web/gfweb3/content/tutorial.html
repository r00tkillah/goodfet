<h1>GoodFET Tutorials</h1>

<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>Construct your GoodFET using the components listed in its Hardware page.  As of
March 2010, you probably want a GoodFET3x for embedded systems
development or a GoodFET2x for voltage glitching security research.
All previous models are still supported by the programming
software.</p>

<!--jbest: finally added the construction tutorial. March 2010-->
<p>If you are new to surface mount components, start with the
<a href=/construction/>Construction Guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Verification</h3>

<p>If your GoodFET is properly assembled, you should see a notice in
dmesg that an FTDI USB/Serial adapter has been added on insertion of
the device.  The device name varies with operating system, but it's probably
one of /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyU0, or /dev/tty/cu.usbserial-*.</p>

<p>You should also see the RX/TX LEDs blink briefly when inserting the
device.  If they do not, their polarity is likely wrong and you will
need to desolder and rotate them.  For those without an SMD rework
station, it might be easier to burn the LEDs off and apply fresh
ones.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>Until a stable release of the GoodFET software is available, you will
need to track the project by svn.  This makes upgrading a breeze, but
you will not be able to install the software by your favorite Linux
distribution's package manager.</p>

<p>Running the following commands will download the latest version
of the project to ~/svn/goodfet and link the client scripts into
/usr/local/bin/.  Optionally, you may add the client directory to
your $PATH if you do not have sudo privileges.</p>

<p><pre>mkdir ~/svn
cd ~/svn
svn co https://goodfet.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/goodfet
cd goodfet/trunk/client
sudo make link
</pre><br/></p>

<p>The client requires a number of prerequisite packages, most notable
python-sqlite3 and python-serial.  For Windows, you need a 32-bit
version of Python as python-serial does not work in 64-bit on that
platform.</p>

<p>You will also need to set an environment variable so that the GoodFET
client knows which model of GoodFET you have.  For example, if you have
a GoodFET41, set the variable like so in your /etc/environment script.</p>
<p><pre>export board=goodfet41</pre></p>

<p>Now that the software is installed, dump the info flash of your
GoodFET to a text file for safekeeping.  This information is destroyed
when flashing the device, and in the rare even that it is needed, it
is very handy to have.  If you have the time, it would be nice to
email a copy of this file to Travis Goodspeed &lt;travis at
radiantmachines.com&gt;.</p>

<p><pre>goodfet.bsl --dumpinfo &gt;info.txt
</pre><br/></p>

<p>Once this backup has been made, you can use goodfet.bsl to install
a recent version of the firmware from the Internet.  This is faster
than building the firmware from scratch, which is described in the
next section.</p>

<p><pre>goodfet.bsl --fromweb
goodfet.monitor test
</pre><br/></p>

<h3>Firmware</h3>

<p>There are two ways to get the firmware.  By far the fastest is to
use the web version by 'goodfet.bsl --fromweb', but participation in
development of the project will require you to build it from
scratch.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://mspgcc.sourceforge.net/">mspgcc</a> compiler is
preferred for the project.  Binary packages used to be hard to find,
but nowadays you can just install it from many unix package repositories.
In Ubuntu (11.10 or later with universe enabled) or Debian, use the
following.</p>

<p><pre>pro% apt-cache search msp430
binutils-msp430 - Binary utilities supporting TI's MSP430 targets
gcc-msp430 - GNU C compiler (cross compiler for MSP430)
gdb-msp430 - The GNU debugger for MSP430
msp430-libc - Standard C library for TI MSP430 development
msp430mcu - Spec files, headers and linker scripts for TI's MSP430 targets
mspdebug - debugging tool for MSP430 microcontrollers
pro% sudo apt-get install binutils-msp430 gcc-msp430 msp430-libc msp430mcu
</pre></p>

<p>Once you have a working compiler and client, you can compile and
install the firmware like so.  Be sure that your $board variable is set
as described earlier in the tutorial.</p>

<p><pre>pro% cd ~/svn/goodfet/trunk/firmware 
pro% board=goodfet41 make clean install</pre></p>

<p>You probably also want to install the info file, as this saves your
GoodFET from having to autocalibrate its clock.  With info.txt in your
firmware directory, run the following.</p>

<p><pre>pro% cd ~/svn/goodfet/trunk/firmware 
pro% board=goodfet41 make installinfo</pre></p>


<h3>Use</h3>

<p>Once your GoodFET has been flashed with the appropriate firmware
and an info file, you can grab a list of installed applications from
the monitor.</p>

<p><pre>pro% board=z1 goodfet.monitor listapps full
GoodFET with f26f MCU
Clocked at 0x8f74
Build Date: 2012-03-27 17:11
Firmware apps:
Monitor
        The monitor app handles basic operations on the MSP430
        such as peeking and poking memory, calling functions and
        managing the baud rate.

SPI
        The SPI app handles the SPI bus protocol, turning
        your GoodFET into a USB-to-SPI adapter.

CCSPI
        The CCSPI app adds support for the Chipcon SPI register
        interface. Unfortunately, there is very little similarity
        between the CC2420 and the CC2500, to name just two of the
        myriad of Chipcon SPI radios.  Auto-detection will be a bit
        difficult, but more to the point, all high level functionality
        must be moved into the client.
