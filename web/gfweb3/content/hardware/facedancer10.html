<h1>Facedancer10</h1>

<p>The GoodFET41 is the fourteenth hardware revision of the GoodFET,
owing its heritage to
the <a href="/hardware/goodfet41/">GoodFET41</a>.  Unlike the
general-purpose GoodFET boards, the only purpose of this board is to
allow USB devices to be written in host-side Python, so that one
workstation can fuzz-test the USB device drivers of another host.
</p>

<h2>CAD Files</h2>

<p>Eagle CAD 5.x files for the design can be found in
/targets/facedancer10 of the subversion repository, or as
<a href="/releases/facedancer.zip">facedancer10.zip</a>.</p>

<h2>Bill of Materials</h2>

<p>The MSP430F2618TPM may be replaced with a 2617, 2619, 2417, 2418,
or 2419 chip, provided that the $mcu variable is set.</p>

<p>Resistor values can be approximated.  Be sure to get the 64 pin
variant of the MSP430F2618, as 80-pin versions are also manufactured.</p>
