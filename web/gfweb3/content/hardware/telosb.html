<p>The Telos B is a wireless sensor development platform which is also
sold as a MoteIV TMote Sky.  While the hardware predates the GoodFET
project, the two share many design similarities, allowing a port
with little trouble.
</p>

<h2>Building</h2>

<p>Build and flash firmware with the following commands.  The
$board variable must be set whenever the client is used, and the
device will not function without it.</p>

<pre>export board=telosb
make clean install
goodfet.ccspi info
goodfet.spiflash info</pre>

<h2>Schematics</h2>

<p>Schematics for the devices are identical, and they can be found in
the contrib/ directory of the subversion repository.
</p>

<!-- CAD Files would go here, but we didn't make the board. -->

<!-- Bill of Materials, Construction -->


<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>The <a href="/clients/goodfetspiflash/">goodfet.spiflash</a>
client cannot determine the size or model of the SPI Flash chip in the
TMote Sky, whose chip differs somehow from the otherwise identical
Telos B.  Reads, writes, and erases perform as expected.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>A few nifty examples are covered in the
article <a href="http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.com/2011/03/goodfet-on-telosb-tmote-sky.html">GoodFET
on the TelosB, TMote Sky</a>.  Specifically, the device is good for
802.15.4 packet sniffing and injection, as well as for the quick
prototyping of new
applications.  <a href="http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/">Scapy</a>
integration also allows for packet dissection.</p>
