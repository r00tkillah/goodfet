<h1>GoodFET40</h1>

<p>The GoodFET40 is the twelfth hardware revision of the GoodFET,
owing its heritage to the <a href="/hardware/goodfet21/">GoodFET21</a>
and <a href="/hardware/goodfet31/">GoodFET31</a>.  It retains the small
BOM of the GoodFET31 while using the more powerful microcontroller of the
GoodFET21.  The PCB USB connector has been dropped in favor of a Mini USB
receptable, allowing PCBs to be manufactured on very thin boards, suitable
for embedding within the cases of other electronics.
</p>

<p><b>N.B. This version has been discontinued due to the boards being
insufficiently thick to handle the mechanical stress of the 0.1&quot;
header.  Use the <a href="/hardware/goodfet41/">GoodFET41</a>
instead.</b></p>

<h2>CAD Files</h2>

<p>Eagle CAD 5.x files for the design can be found in
/branches/goodfet40 of the subversion repository, or as
<a href="/releases/goodfet40.zip">goodfet40.zip</a>.</p>

<h2>Bill of Materials</h2>

<p>The MSP430F2618TPM may be replaced with a 2617, 2619, 2417, 2418,
or 2419 chip.  LEDs may be of any color, but a smaller series resistor
should be used in such a case.</p>

<p>Resistor values can be approximated.  Be sure to get the 64 pin
variant of the MSP430F2618.</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>

<i>Coming soon.</i>

<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>The USB positioning holes do not match many brands of connector.
If the part doesn't fit, break the tabs from the connector and rely
upon the solder points for proper positioning.</p>

<p>The board is too thin for use without a supporting case, causing
some boards to flex and become damaged.  For this reason,
the <a href="/hardware/goodfet41/">GoodFET41</a> uses a thicker PCB.</p>
