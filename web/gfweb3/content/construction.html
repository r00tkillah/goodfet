<h3>Necessities</h3>

<p>Besides the components listed on the page that corresponds to your
particular PCB, there are a number of things you'll want to have on
hand before assembling a GoodFET.</p>

<p>This list isn't meant to be all-inclusive, nor are all of these
items necessarily required. This is simply a list of tools that will
help with assembling a GoodFET.</p>
 
<h3>Prepare the work area</h3>

<p>You'll want a nice, clutter-free work area.  You might want to
remove all of the surface mount components from their packaging and
put them in their own labeled bins for easy access.  The trash that
accumulates from the packaging will build up quickly as you work on
the board.  Make sure your soldering iron is in a spot where you won't
get it tangled up in anything or accidentally burn something.  Be sure
you have easy access to your flux, solder, brass sponge, desoldering
braid, tweezers, helping hands/magnifier, and soldering iron holder.
A little extra lighting goes a long way here, so grab an extra desk
lamp or work light if you have one.</p>

<h3>Prepare the tools and board</h3>

<p>Make sure the PCB you'll be working on is clean and free of oils
and dirt (from fingerprints, etc.).  99% isopropyl alcohol will
quickly take care of anything that will prevent a good contact between
the components and the board.  Heat up the soldering iron enough to
melt the solder, and make sure the tip is clean and tinned.  If this
is your first time surface mounting components, this is a good time to
become familiar with the methods you'll be using to solder the ICs to
the board.</p>

<h3>Practice</h3>

<p>Once the iron is hot, apply a small amount of flux to a PCB.  If
you don't have a spare PCB, the USB portion of the GoodFET PCB will
work.  Cut some desoldering braid (about 6'') and some solder from each
of their spools.  Heat up the flux (you will it burn) and apply some
solder directly to the PCB.  Never apply solder directly to the
soldering iron.  Remove the iron and the solder, then lay the
desoldering braid on top of the soldered area.  Gently press the tip
of the soldering iron over the area that you previously applied the
solder.  The desoldering braid will heat up (so watch your fingers),
and it will begin to melt the solder.  The desoldering braid will suck
up all but a small amount of the solder you applied to the board.</p>

<h3>Soldering the FT232R/FT232RL</h3>

<p>The ICs are probably the most intimidating components of the board,
but they are the easiest to solder.  Place the FT232RL on the board,
ensuring the small circle on the chip is in the same corner as the
small circle silk-screened on the board (the lower right when viewed
from the top with the USB portion pointing to the left).  With masking
tape, cover half of the IC so that the pins on one side are
visible. Align the pins that are still showing and tape the IC to the
board.  Now, cover the uncovered half with a second piece of masking
tape and uncover the first half.  Repeat this until you're sure that
all of the pins are aligned properly, but leave half of the IC taped
to the board.  You'll be moving the board around, so be sure it will
stay put.</p>

<p>Now, apply flux to the side you'll be soldering.  Run your iron
across the leads on the board once or twice to get the board hot, then
apply solder to the leads while running the iron across.  You don't
need a whole lot of solder, just enough to make a small contact
between the IC and the board.  Applying the solder should take less
than 5 seconds.  If you accidentally bridge some of the pins, don't
worry; we'll be applying desoldering braid to the entire side anyway
to ensure we haven't bridged anything.</p>

<p>Take the desoldering braid and lay it across the pins of the IC.
Gently pin the desoldering braid down with the soldering iron and rub
the pins with the desoldering braid.  You should be moving the
desoldering braid with the iron, so the portion of desoldering braid
that is in contact with the board remains hot.  You might need to use
different areas of the desoldering braid if one becomes saturated with
solder.  Continue rubbing the board with desoldering braid until the
pins are clean.  Check to see if any of the pins are bridged from
below.  If you see blobs of solder underneath the chip, you will have
to draw them out with your iron and repeat the desoldering process.
To draw out the solder, hold the board so that gravity will pull on
the solder as you heat the pins.</p>

<p>Once you've finished that side of the chip, remove the masking tape
holding the IC in place.  It takes very little solder to hold the chip
to the board; you don't have to worry about the chip moving around
without the tape.  Flux the other side, heat the pins, apply solder,
and then clean up with the desoldering braid.  You've just surface
mounted the first IC!  Repeat this process for each of the remaining
ICs.</p>

<h3>Soldering the components</h3>

<p>The 100 Ohm series resistors are probably the easiest components to
start with.  Place one on the board (they are non-directional, you
only need to worry about placing them so each side touches each solder
pad).  Apply a small amount of flux to the side you will solder first.
Like before, you will heat the place that you will apply solder to,
and then apply the solder.  The component might move around a little
as you apply the solder.  Using your tweezers or a small knife, move
the component back into place, applying heat to the solder with your
iron as necessary.  Once the part is properly aligned, solder the
other side of the component.</p>

<p>The LEDs are the toughest components to solder.  It is very
important to ensure that they are oriented correctly before you solder
them to the board. Some surface mount LEDs have indicators on them to
tell you the polarity, but some markings are rather vague. Use the
"LED Test" function of a multi-meter to determine the polarity of the
LED. Use the circuit diagram for the GoodFET you are soldering to
determine the correct orientation, and then solder the component
appropriately.</p>

<h3>Soldering the headers</h3>

<p>Back to through-hole soldering!  Break up your headers into two
rows of seven. If you have a connector that will accept these headers
(an old floppy drive cable will work), plug the headers into that
cable.  This will ensure the headers will be aligned properly against
each other.  Flip the board over and guide the rows of headers through
the board.  Apply a small amount of flux and solder one pin to the
board.  Flip the board back over and ensure the headers are
perpendicular to the board. If they are not, heat the pin that you
soldered and move the headers into place.  It is very difficult to
move the headers once you have soldered more than one pin!  Once the
headers are aligned properly, solder the rest of the pins to the
board.</p>

<h3>Add solder to the USB connector</h3>

<p>Finally, add a small amount of flux to the USB connector, and add
some solder to each of the four pads.  You're done soldering your
GoodFET!</p>

<h3>Clean the board</h3>

<p>Use the manufacturer's recommended solvent for the flux you used on
the board.  A soft toothbrush can help loosen any flux that's hard to
remove.</p>

<h3>Use the board</h3>

<p>Once dry, your GoodFET is ready to use!</p>
