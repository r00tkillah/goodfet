<h1>GoodFET31</h1>

<p>The GoodFET31 is the eighth hardware revision of the GoodFET.  It
aims to reduce BOM cost and board surface area, as well as reducing
the parts count for kit builders.</p>

<h2>CAD Files</h2>

<p>Eagle CAD 5.x files for the design can be found in
/branches/goodfet31 of the subversion repository, or as
<a href="/releases/goodfet31.zip">goodfet31.zip</a>.</p>

<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>Some models of the GoodFET31 were mistakenly manufactured at standard
thickness instead of the necessary increased thickness.  To use one of
these models, either solder on a USB cable or use a folded business
card as a wedge.</p>
