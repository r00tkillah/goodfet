<h1>GoodFET30</h1>

<p>The GoodFET30 is the third hardware revision of the GoodFET.
It aims to reduce BOM cost and board surface area while at the
same time increasing performance.  All crystals have been removed
in favor of internally-calibrated oscillators, and external
pull-up resistors have been dropped in favor of internal
pulling resistors.
</p>

<p>N.B., The GoodFET30 is the upcoming revision of the GoodFET.
Hardware has been ordered, but this documentation reflects
equipment which has not yet been assembled.</p>

<h2>CAD Files</h2>

<p>Eagle CAD 5.x files for the design can be found in
/branches/goodfet30 of the subversion repository, or as
<a href="/releases/goodfet30.zip">goodfet30.zip</a>.</p>
