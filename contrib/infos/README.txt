Info Flash Images
for MSP430F2xx Chips

If you get baud errors on 2xx boards, flashing one of these images
might fix the problem.  Then again, it might not.

The model numbers come from the GoodFET model, so sometimes 2274 and
'54 chips are confused, or 2618 and 2418.  The sets are assembled into
tables for analysis and the GoodFETs auto-configuration routine.

Thank you kindly,
